Presentation
============

collective.cmissearch is a Plone 3.2+ extension that let you search
into a `CMIS`_ document repository from Plone.

*This doesn't integrate the Plone search functionally with external
`CMIS`_ data*.  This provides a simple search form that do search both in
Plone and in an `CMIS`_ repository.

This extension depends on `collective.cmisbrowser`. Each *CMIS
Browser* will indicate a starting point from which the searches will
be done.
